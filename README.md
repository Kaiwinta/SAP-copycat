# SAP copycat
The goal is to copy the SAP app based of the utilisation i do and on what i'm able to see
I also will change some Functionnality in order to adapt to the use i want and to an optimisation for smaller factorys

Requirements:   
    - Some database of package and order 
        - Some database of what does contain every order
    
    -Being able to create database with a script

    -A simple tkinter interface as usual

    - Good request
    - adding an admin mod that help you track what was done
    - adding some user database and password to acces to admin


Challenge:
    -Trying to sync some object oriented programmtion with some database

Database Structure:

    There's 2 database:

        Command.db:
            Role:       Handling and saving all the order of the client
            Tables:     Order, Package, Product
            Relation:   An order is compposed by one or many package that are also composed by one or many product

        Product.db:
            Role:       All the different product the store can sell
            Tables:     ProductListed
            Relation:   The product in Commanbd.db are linked to this database by the product_type parameter
            
        I made 2 different database to separate the Client and the Store, Store can modify some product in the product database without having to modify all the order that contain this product.


Class Logic:

    Order:      Order are generated by the user 
                Not all order will be generated at the same time

                Action of scanning a Packages:
                    We search if the order that contain this package are already generated or not
                    If it's generated, we go in the package
                    If not: We generate the order and all the packages in it?.

                All the packages of an order muss be ended before starting another order
                And when the order is ended we destroiy the variable and update database


    Packages:   Packages are generated when we create an order.
                The products in it are only generated as python instance when we scan the Package
                But the product are already in the database
                But in order to use less memory, we generate only one packages at the time.
                When the Package is ended we destroy all the product and the Package and update the database

    Products:   Are generated by the Packages and destroyed when we end the Package and updated the database

We muss do every Command at a time, we muss end all the packages in it before starting another in order to optimize memory complexity.
